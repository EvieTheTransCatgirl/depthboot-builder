# Depthboot: your **Chromebook**, your way

Choose between a variety of common Linux distributions and desktop environments to create a bootable image for any
[supported](https://eupnea-project.github.io/docs/project/supported-devices) 64-bit Chromebook, without modifying
firmware.

[Due to licensing restraints Depthboot cannot be distributed as an iso](https://eupnea-project.github.io/faq#why-is-sharing-depthboot-images-illegal).
Instead, it has to be built locally.

## Depthboot vs Mainline

(Mainline = stock, unmodified Linux distribution)

**Mainline Linux:**

* Requires either replacing firmware completely (UEFI) or changing a part of it (rw_legacy). Not all devices have both
  options and there is a slight risk of bricking the Chromebook.
* Some hardware may not work (touchscreen, touchpad, etc.)
* Audio is mostly unsupported.

**Depthboot:**

* Requires no modifications to firmware.
* Hardware support matches ChromeOS.
* Extensive audio support, with active development to bring further support.
